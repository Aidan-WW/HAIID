DOWNLOADING THE PROJECT AND SETTING UP GITHUB
You need to download the entire github repo, I then recommend installing github desktop and accessing that folder and recongising it as the HAIID repo. That way yours and our changes can be automatically recognised and pushed and pulled.

SETTING UP AND RUNNING THE BACKEND
So the backend itself is the app folder on the github.
To run the backend server, just run main.py
Before you do this, you need to set that IP address to your IP address. 
At the bottom of main.py will be "app.run(host='192.168.0.11', port=5000, debug=True)"
Find your own ipv4 local IP address with ipconfig
and then replace '192.168.0.11' with your ip address that you've found
you can now run main.py - it may take a couple minutes!
It should be running on your local machine at port 5000. This can be accessed from across your LAN (i.e. from your phone).

CHANGING THE FRONTEND
You can follow what I have done in frontend/screens/TabOneScreen.tsx (this is a dummy app)
Install axios (npm install)
import axios from 'axios'
you can then use axios.get and axios.post functions
.then .catch .finally are used within this
Documentation  https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
Tutorial https://aboutreact.com/react-native-axios/

for example:
  const getDataUsingSimpleGetCall = () => {
    axios
      .get('http://192.168.0.11:5000/some_thing')  //CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS AS NEEDED!!! (according to main.py)
      .then(function (response) {
        // handle success
        alert(JSON.stringify(response.data));
      })
      .catch(function (error) {
        // handle error
        alert(error.message);
      })
      .finally(function () {
        // always executed
        alert('Finally called');
      });
  }
/some_thing just gives a dummy response from the backend

you can then store these in variables to work with in the js.

THE BACK-END CALLS:
get_progress
JSON: {"value":float_value_of_progress,
"species":species_name}

get_meal_plan

some_thing
JSON: {"message":dummy_message}
